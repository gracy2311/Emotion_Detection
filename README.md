# Emotion_detection
This Emotion Detection project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify human emotions from text or facial expressions. The model can classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, and neutral. It is built using Python, with libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or OpenCV (for facial analysis) and NLTK or transformers (for text-based emotion detection). It can be integrated into chatbots, mental health apps, or sentiment analysis tools. The system processes input in real-time and predicts the underlying emotional state, helping enhance user experience and support emotionally intelligent applications.
